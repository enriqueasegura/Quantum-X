# Quantum Notebooks, Tutorials, Etc. 

This started as a repository to implement Farhi's papers on Quantum Neural Networks when I was applying to X's Quantum Residency. 

But it evolved into something more meaningful: this repository is my journal of the many times, many efforts and shots I have taken to join a residency, internship, or any kind of program on quantum computing. 

Goes without saying, it has been a hard road but a instructive one: to push myself to learn optimization methods, physics theory, and bits and bits of programming geared towards quantum computing has been quite an experience. 

I do hope I somehow, one day, make it to a good PhD in quantum information and computing, and then on to internships, a postdoc, and hopefully, a staff scientist job in this field. 

Quantum Computing is quite literally what I have been betting my life on since I was a high school junior. And I hope to be proven correct on taking such a bet at such an early age. 

So, if you are here because you googled key words to implement stuff, and yet, oddly enough stumble upon this site know this: it is worth it. 

And I hope that the tutorials you found here are helpful - and hopefully readable. I have tried my best to follow the feedback I got from Stefan at X of making every colab notebook pedagogical.

Please contact me if you have any feedback that can make any of these tutorials helpful. 

And above all: Good luck!
